This repository contains blog posts that introduce the [assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) programming language. For this moment, all the content and examples cover only the [x86_64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) processors and the GNU Linux operating system. In the future, I plan to post learning materials for the [ARM64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64) architecture.

Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, these posts are intended for everyone to learn the assembly programming language. The posts cover the following topics:

- Basic description of the x86_64 processor architecture
- How to write, build, and run a simple program written in the assembly programming language
- The main parts of which a program for Linux consists
- Basics of memory allocation, what is stack and heap
- What is a system call and how does your program interact with an operating system
- How floating point numbers are represented in a computer memory
- How to call assembly code from a C program
- And many more...

Have fun!
